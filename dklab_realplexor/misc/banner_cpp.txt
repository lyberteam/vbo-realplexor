ATTENTION: Java-style C++ programming below. :-)

This is a line-by-line C++ rewrite of Perl prototype code with obvious speed
optimizations (like avoiding excess copies, config pre-parsing etc.).

The code is so compact (2600 lines) and so simple, that I decided not to
split it into *.hpp & *.cpp files nor create Makefiles, but place
everything into included *.h files (like Perl, Java, C# and most of other
languages do). It is not quite common for C++, but it surely simple
when a program is small (especially when it is rewritten line by line
from another language).

Also the code has global variables within the top namespace: one variable
per Storage and one CONFIG, they are like singletons.
